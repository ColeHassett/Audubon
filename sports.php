			<h2><img title="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eagles_wordmark.gif" alt="" src="media/eagles.gif"/><br />The Eagles</h2>

			<h4>Stadium: Lincoln Financial Field</h4>

			<p>The team that brings out the most passion in Philadelphia fans is our own Philadelphia Eagles. Originally a team for Frankford named the Yellow Jackets, the Philadelphia Eagles took over when
			the Yellow Jackets ran out of money. Since then the Eagles have established two main rivals inside of their division with the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys. These rivals do not stop off the
			field either, as the fans carry out this rivalry more so than the players. If you are a sports fan, attending an Eagles game on any given Sunday will be the highlite of your visit. Even if you are not a
			Philadelphia fan, you can feel the love for the game resonating from the stands as they sing the beloved anthem and chant E-A-G-L-E-S, EAGLES!</p>

			<h2><img title="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Philadelphia_Phillies_Insignia.svg" alt="" src="media/phillies.png"><br />The Phillies</h2>

			<h4>Stadium: Citizen's Bank Park</h4>

			<p>At one time, the Philadelphia Phillies were running the city of Philadelphia. From around 2007 until 2011 the Phillies were at their prime. They won their division each year
			and the World Series in 2008. When you look at the Phillies any time before or after that period, you will see that Philadelphia fans have been disappointed for many years. Don't let that
			disuade you as the fans at the games are just as passionate as you would expect and are always a great event for family or friends. If you are at the game, don't forget to join in on any waves you
			see coming around the stadium!</p>

			<hr />

			<h2><img title="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FlyersWordmark.png" alt="" src="media/Flyers.png"/><br />The Flyers</h2>

			<h4>Stadium: Wells Fargo Center</h4>

			<p>The Philadelphia Flyers can certaintly not be forgotten when talking about Philly teams. Hockey, being a sport emphasizing physical contact, fits perfectly in the the scene you would expect
			to see a raging Philadelphia fan at. The nickname of the Flyers, The Broadstreet Bullies, only adds to the persona of Philadelphia sports. Where else would you expect to find a team known for their
			phyiscal play overpowering their actual skill at the game. In terms of performance over the years, the Flyers are pretty consistently good. They make it to the playoffs more often than most other teams
			in the league. In the 2009-2010 season they even made it all the way to the Stanley Cup only to be beaten. So, if you're in town an want to see a good game of hockey, you know where to find it!</p>

			<h2><img title="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Philadelphia_76ers-jersey-2010.png" alt="" src="media/sixers.png"/><br />The 76ers</h2>

			<h4>Stadium: Wells Fargo Center</h4>

			<p>The 76ers are the least liked team of all the Philadelphia teams. Unfortunately, the 76ers rarely make it to the playoffs, bar a miracle. Now, if you know basketball, you probably already
			know that that miracle did come to us for about 10 years when Julius Erving reigned supreme. In his time with the Sixers, 1976-1987, we had the most success in our history. Another big name
			in Philadelphia is Allen Iverson who played for the 76ers in the early 2000s. We had another set of good years with him and then headed right back to rebuilding when he left. With all that said,
			the 76ers have picked up a few great players in the past, so come to a game and maybe you will get to see the next great player!</p>
