			<h3>Independence National Park</h3>

			<p>Independence National Park is a great park not only for it's open grass patches in the midst of Philadelphia, but also for the great attractions surrounding this park. A few of the
			sites to see when you stop by are Independence Hall, Congress Hall, and of course the Liberty Bell! Stop in at any of these great locations for free to see where some of the most important
			points in history of making this country took place. At Independence Hall you will be able to see where our Founding Fathers actually signed the Declaration of Independence and evenetually
			begin the United States Constitution.</p>

			<h3><img title="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinwburkett/3354192063LOVE" alt="" src="media/lovepark.jpg"/><br />Love Park</h3>

			<p>You may recognize this park from photos you've seen of friends or family standing in front of Robert Indiana's "LOVE" sculpture. This is quite possibly one of the largest tourist attractions
			in Philadelphia specifically for photos. Every couple or family that visits Philly wants to get their picture taken to prove their devotion to one another. Whether you think it's cheesy or not,
			the LOVE sculpture is a part of our culture an we accept that with open arms. Although, it has not always been hugs and kisses in LOVE Park for our great sculpture. Only two years after the
			sculpture was placed in the park, it was removed! Luckily, the sculpture was purchased and safely returned back to the park where it shall remain forever.</p>

			<h3>Valley Forge National Historical Park</h3>

			<p>Valley Forge Park is another park you have probably come across if you made it through middle school history class. This park is perhaps the epitome of what kind of sacrifices had to be made
			in the War for Independence. Though you will see many cannons and trenches throughout the park, it is amazing to know that no battles actually took place at this park! The enemy that took the most
			lives here was the harsh winter, which led to hunger among troops as well as extreme outbreak of disease. Why would they brave such tragic elements with no victories to show? Well, under the command
			of our first president, George Washington, these troops were able to hold the strategic position of Valley Forge through six months of the grueling winter. Once that winter was over, it was time to strike.
			Washington and his troops were able to come out strong enough to win many impacting battles and help bring Independence to America.<br /><br />Today, we have to deal with none of these harsh conditions
			when taking a drive or strole through Valley Forge Park. When you arrive you will be greeted by a beautiful welcome center full of artifacts from the war and other souvenirs. Head out the door with
			a map of the park and go wherever you please! Valley Forge Park is massive and ready to be rediscovered by you!</p>

			<h3>Fairmount Park</h3>

			<p>Fairmount Park is an incredibly large park running through the great city of Philadelphia. If you are a resident of the city, this is your go to park for whatever you want to do. Fairmount Park
			is so large that it has everything to offer from bike trails to concert venues. On the outskirts of the park near the Philadelphia Museum of Art you can spot the beautiful location that has come to be
			known as Boathouse Row. If you are lucky enough to be coming into the city or leaving at night, be sure to take a glance across the river as Boathouse Row lights up! After a long day walking around and seeing
			the great sites of Philadelphia, Fairmount Park is a great place to relax and enjoy the sunset.</p>
