			<p>As a resident of the town of Audubon, Audubon Elementary School will be the place where your kids start their schooling in the Methacton School District. Audubon Elementary is a lovely little school
			that brings back that schoolhouse feel with it's architecture. Your kids will be able to run around safely in the playground located in the back of the school. At Audubon Elementary your kids will
			enjoy a variety of classes from science and math to art and history. We love being able to welcome new familes into the Methacton School District!</p>

			<h2><img title="https://www.thinglink.com/scene/525488862206623744" alt="" src="media/skyview.jpeg"/>Arcola Intermediate &amp; Skyview Upper Elementary School</h2>

			<p>Originally all that stood atop this giant hill was Arcola Intermediate school, but Skyview Upper Elementary School was recently built to meet the demand of the ever-growing community of Methacton.
			Students in fith and sixth grade now attend Skyview, while our seventh and eighth graders remain in Arcola Intermediate. This allowed the school district to move all the fifth graders into a more suited
			environment and make more room for the younger students at the elementary school. That being said, you can look forward to modern design and technology when your children make it to Skyview. They can then
			look forward to attending Arcola and get the chance to start competing with other schools in their favorite sport or at academic competitions! Though Arcola is an older school, it still offers great life
			skills for every student. While mainting your normal classes like math and science, students learn how to cook, sew, and even things like photoshop and woodworking. Overall your child will come out of these
			two schools with great skills under their belt.</p>

			<p>Coming to the end of their schooling with Methacton School District, our students head to Methacton High School. Here the focus shifts more to just the typical school classes like math and science
			as students prepare to delve into the world of college. Extracurriculars at Methacton adhere to all students whether they want to pursure music in band or continue their sports career on one of the many
		 	sports teams available. We will be sad to see our students leave, but we can be happy knowing we gave them all we have to offer!</p>
