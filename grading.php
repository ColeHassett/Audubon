			<p>In this project, I have performed in many categories dealing with web development. Here is a list of where I believe I have excelled: </p>

			<ul>
				<li>The overall design of my site is very consitent. The same shade of blue is used across main portions of the page, while the images for the header and background also pair well.</li>
				<li>I have made good use of some javascript functions in my site to make the navigation and use of the gallery very fluid.</li>
				<li>By placing the resource and grading page in the header, I separate them from the main content of the page so a normal use would not have to worry about interacting with them.</li>
				<li>The content in my site is categorized appropriately and leads the user in the desired direction. Whether it is getting tickets to an attraction or finding a relaxing place to spend the day.</li>
				<li>The scalability of my site is very well put together so that all elements will retain their form when the window is shrunk.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I also feel that there are a few areas that could use improvement in my site. Here are a few: </p>

			<ul>
				<li>The right hand banner on each page seems to not fit the site, and I feel the space could definitely be used much more effectively.</li>
				<li>On the pages where I implement interactable objects, the background makes it feel a bit clunky. I would have liked to be able to flush that out a bit more.</li>
				<li>A feature that would make the site a bit more appealing to the eye would be to add changing images to the header or the background.</li>
			</ul>
