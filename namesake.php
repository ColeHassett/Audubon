			<h2>John James Audubon</h2>

			<h2><img title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birds_of_America" alt="" src="media/birdsofamerica.jpg"/></h2>

			<p>John James Audubon was a very well known ornithologist, study of birds, in his day. Also known for being a naturalist and a painter he went on to use all of these skills to write "Audubon's Birds of America".
			This book is still held to be one of the greatest ornithological works of all time even after almost two hundred years. "Audubon's Birds of America" is significant in that it depicts each bird in its natural
			habitat. In his lifetime, John James Audubon was able to discover twenty-five new species of birds.</p>

			<h3>His Life</h3>

			<p>John James Audubon was born in the French colony we now call Haiti. His father was a French naval officer and owned a sugarcane plantation, and his mother was a chambermaid but died when Audubon was only
			a few months old. In 1789 Audubon's father sold part of his plantation and bought a farm called Mill Grove just 20 miles outside Philadelphia. Audubon grew up in France and was always very fond of birds.
			At the age of 18, he immigrated to the United States to avoid conscription in the Napoleonic wars. After arriving in New York City, Audubon came down with yellow fever and was transported to Mill Grove.
			It is here where he met Lucy and married her five years later. They had two sons and two daughters, unfortunately both of his daughters died very young. In 1851, at the age of sixty-five, Audubon would
			eventually die after dealing with Alzheimer's disease for almost three years. </p>

			<h3>His Goals</h3>

			<p>Since he was very young, John James Audubon had a great interest in birds. He would talk about how majestic and calculated they were. When Audubon moved to the United States and eventually ended up
			in Mill Grove, he decided he wantes to take this hobby to the next level. It was then and there that he decided he was going to document birds like no other ornithologist before him had done. By painting
			birds in their natural habitat, Audubon was able to capture the birds in a much more realistic way than anyone else. He also began the first known bird-banding, tying yarn to the legs of birds to determine
			if they always return to the same nesting spot, in the United States. Him and his family would then continue to move west as Audubon put together one of the greatest collection of bird documentation to this
			day.</p>

			<h3>How He Made His Work Unique</h3>

			<p>Making your work stand out from a crowd was not an easy task in John James Audubon's day. Since all they had available to them was a few different methods of painting, it was more about the reference
			material. In his day, ornithologists had to be adept in taxidermy because they would first kill a speciment and then stuff it to get a more lifelike referce. Audubon brough something unique to this method
			in that he would not just stuff the bird rigged, but would work the specimen into a lively pose as if it was moving around. Not only was his taxidermy different, but Audbon would also position his specimens
			in more descriptive scenes. For example, he would often place birds near their nests, eggs, and sometimes even their natural predators.</p>
