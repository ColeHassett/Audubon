			<p>Dorney Park is a great location for the whole family if you are seeking a fun filled day. Not only is Dorney Park an amusement park, but it is also paired with a water park to suit everyone's
			desires. Home to renowned roller coasters like Steel Force and Wild Mouse, there's room for the adventurous and those not quite as much. Of course there are plenty of rides for those not seeking the
			thrill of a roller coaster. Maybe you are more of a stomach jerking ride kind of person? Great! Hop aboard any of the array of thrill rides including Demon Drop and Dominator. Don't forget to take a break
			between all those thrills to hop on some of the great water rides like the Wildwater River or Thunder Creek Mountain. Though, if it is cold out, it's probably best to stay dry.</p>

			<p>Are you a zoo fanatic? Then you have come to the right place. The Philadelphia Zoo is not only the first registered zoo in the United States, but it also boasts one of the largest populations
			of animals at a zoo. The Philadelphia Zoo has always put their animals first, whether it be the excellent veterinary services provided to the animals, or simply the overall apprecation they have
			for every animal at the zoo. One of the greatest features you'll notice after visiting is the Zoo 360 experience. This experience gives the animals access to see the zoo themselves, but from above you!
			That's right, there are mesh tubes hoisted above the zoo for animals to walk through so they can have that much more roaming space. Who knows, maybe we are just another exhibit for these animals.
			On top of the animals, the William Penn house sits on the zoo property and adds some beautiful architecture to the land. Needless to say, if you're looking for a great place to get lost for a day,
			the Philadelphia Zoo will not disappoint.</p>
