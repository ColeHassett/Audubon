			Philadelphia Museum of Art boasts the third largest art museum in the country and holds some of the most interesting pieces in history. You can even see medieval armor in one of the many
			period rooms dedicated to different eras in history. On top of all that, there is usually a special showing of an artist going on, so make sure you check it out!</p>
